Develop a console-based 2D game called "Gem Hunters" where players compete to collect the most gems within a set number of turns.
Your implementation of the "Gem Hunters" game looks good! It sets up the game board, allows players to take turns moving and collecting gems, and correctly determines the winner based on the number of gems each player collects. The game continues for a total of 30 turns, with players alternating turns.
